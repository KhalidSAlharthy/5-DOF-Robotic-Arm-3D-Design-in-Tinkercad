# 5-DOF-Robotic-Arm-3D-Design-in-Tinkercad
A 3D-designed 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm, designed using Tinkercad 3D. The arm is ideal for educational purposes, prototyping concepts, and exploring mechanical structure and movement in robotics.

---

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The model includes five independently rotating joints mimicking the structure of real robotic manipulators allowing it to perform a range of movements such as lifting, rotating, extending, and gripping.

- Base Rotation

- Shoulder Joint

- Elbow Joint

- Wrist Joint

- Gripper (End Effector)
