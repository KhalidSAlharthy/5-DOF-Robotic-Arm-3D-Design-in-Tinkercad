# 5-DOF-Robotic-Arm-3D-Design-in-Tinkercad
This project features a 3D model of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm, designed using Tinkercad 3D. The arm is ideal for educational purposes, prototyping concepts, and exploring mechanical structure and movement in robotics.

---

# 📌 Project Overview
The robotic arm consists of five movable joints:

- Base Rotation

- Shoulder Joint

- Elbow Joint

- Wrist Joint

- Gripper (End Effector)
